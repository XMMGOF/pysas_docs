    "The OM can operate in Imaging, Fast, and Grism mode. Each of these modes has dedicated commands to reprocess the data: omichain, omfchain, and omgchain. These are metatasks that each call several procedures that are used to prepare the data for processing, make and apply flatfield images, and detect sources. The tasks omichain and omfchain also calculate the instrumental magnitudes of sources, find the position of the sources (in equatorial coordinates), and produce a sky image; omgchain produces a spectrum. If you run these chains, it is helpful to inspect the sas_log file to get a detailed list of the performed tasks. These chains rely on filters specified by the user; if no arguments are given, they run on all the files present in the ODF directory. Due to the long file names and the large number of input parameters, users are urged to simply use the chains and not run the chains' individual tasks one at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most OM data are obtained in Imaging mode. If they were obtained in the Fast mode, there will be an additional event list file corresponding to the Fast window (*FAE.FIT). Reprocessing of data taken in Fast mode using the command line and SAS GUI is discussed in ยง12.3. Reprocessing OM Grism data is discussed in ยง12.4."

    "Before proceeding with this notebook, it is appropriate to discuss the artifacts that often affect OM images. These artifacts can affect the accuracy of a measurement by e.g., increasing the background level.\n",
    "\n",
    "Stray light - background celestial light is reflected by the OM detector housing onto the center on the OM field of view, producing a circular area of high background. This can also produce looping structures and long streaks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Modulo 8 noise - In the raw images, a modulo 8 pattern arises from imperfections in the event centroiding algorithm in the OM electronics. This is removed during image processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Smoke rings - light from bright sources is reflected from the entrance window back on the detector, producing faint rings located radially away from the center of the field of view.\n",
    "\n",
    "Out-of-time events - sources with count rates of several tens of counts/sec show a strip of events along the readout direction, corresponding to photons that arrived while the detector was being read out.\n",
    "\n",
    "Further, artifacts also can contaminate grism data. Due to this mode's complexity, users are urged to be very careful when working with grism data, and should refer to the [SOC's website on this topic](https://xmm-tools.cosmos.esa.int/external/xmm_user_support/documentation/sas_usg/USG/omgnotes.html \"SOC's website on this topic\").\n",
