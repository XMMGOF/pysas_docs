If your observation is of a bright source, you again might want to select only the single pixel events to mitigate pile up (see §6.8 and §6.9 for a more detailed discussion).

    "A few words about interpretting the plots are in order. The top is the distribution of counts versus PI channel for each pattern class (single, double, triple, quadruple), and the bottom is the expected pattern distribution (smooth lines) plotted over the observed distribution (histogram). The lower plot shows the model distributions for single and double events and the observed distributions. It also gives the ratio of observed-to-modeled events with 1-$\\sigma$ uncertainties for single and double pattern events over a given energy range. (The default is 0.5-2.0 keV; this can be changed with the pileupnumberenergyrange parameter.) If the data is not piled up, there will be good agreement between the modeled and observed single and double event pattern distributions. Also, the observed-to-modeled fractions for both singles and doubles in the 0.5-2.0 keV range will be unity, within errors. In contrast, if the data is piled up, there will be clear divergence between the modeled and observed pattern distributions, and the observed-to-modeled fraction for singles will be less than 1.0, and for doubles, it will be greater than 1.0.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, when examining the plots, it should noted that the observed-to-modeled fractions can be inaccurate. Therefore, the agreement between the modeled and observed single and double event pattern distributions should be the main factor in determining if an observation is affected by pile up or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "The source used in our Lockman Hole example is too faint to provide reasonable statistics for epatplot and is far from being affected by pile up. For comparison, an example of a bright source (Mkn 421, Obs ID: 0136541101) which is strongly affected by pileup is shown below. Note that the observed-to-model fraction for doubles is over 1.0, and there is severe divergence between the model and the observed pattern distribution."

    "If you're working with a different (much brighter) dataset that does show signs of pile up, there are a few ways to deal with it. First, using the region selection and event file filtering procedures demonstrated in earlier sections, you can excise the inner-most regions of a source (as they are the most heavily piled up), re-extract the spectrum, and continue your analysis on the excised event file. For this procedure, it is recommended that you take an iterative approach: remove an inner region, extract a spectrum, check with epatplot, and repeat, each time removing a slightly larger region, until the model and observed distribution functions agree. If you do this, be aware that removing too small a region with respect to the instrumental pixel size (1.1'' for the MOS, 4.1'' for the PN) can introduce systematic inaccuracies when calculating the source flux; these are less than 4%, and decrease to less than 1% when the excised region is more than 5 times the instrumental pixel half-size. In any case, be certain that the excised region is larger than the instrumental pixel size!\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also use the event file filtering procedures to include only single pixel events (PATTERN==0), as these events are less sensitive to pile up than other patterns."
